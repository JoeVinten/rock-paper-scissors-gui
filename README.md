Created a GUI for the rock paper scissors. with extra 

Styling:

- Learnt and utilised CSS Grid.
- Used the grid-template functionality to set the size and number of rows.
- Used the grid-column for how it spreads over each grid.
- Tried to create a random hover effect which picks from 3 numbers but struggled to do so and will revist later in time.

Javascript:

- Refactored the code to move from console.logs to DOM manipulation using textContent.add function to push the messaging into the correct areas.
- Created a scoreboard which stops at 5 and disabled all the buttons. Once it hits this the reset game button also pops up. This reset the game by using the location.reload() function which refreshes the page.

- The refersh button appears using the .createElement, adds a class, and then appends it to the parent.



Future Additions:

- Make a choice between playing the computer and a friend.
- Build a back end which has a historic scoreboard.
