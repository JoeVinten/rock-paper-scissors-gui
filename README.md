This is the console Section of the Rock, Paper,Scissors Task.

What was involved:

- Creating a function "computerPlay" which creates random numbers and the assings Rock, Paper, or Scissors to each one.
- Building a playRound function which evaluates each scenerio and then returns dynamic messages based on the outcome.
- Building a loop function.
- Using the counter functions to build a score, which was logged at the end of the game function.

The code is commented for reference.
